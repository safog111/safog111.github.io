    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>
        This will be a blog on football data, visualizing it and generally geeking out about things we can do with it. I
        can hear it from across the internet: Data can be manipulated, football cannot be interpreted through data,
        stats are meaningless and so on. I acknowledge your skepticism about football data. For instance who's to stay
        that a player with stellar stats in the Bundesliga can translate those performances to England?
        Or that somoene with the most key passes in the premier league must be a good player and a transfer target for
        your club?
    </p>
    <p>
        There are things we can never know for certain, but that doesn't mean you can just dismiss data off-hand. A data
        revolution is quietly underway in football. Companies like <a href="https://www.statsbomb.com">statsbomb</a>
        have revolutionized approaches around how data gets collected / analyzed. The location of every single touch,
        the angle of a pass, if the pass wasattempted under pressure, and a whole host of other metadata is collected by
        these companies. Researchers are using broadcast video and machine learning to infer these metrics
        automatically.

        a profile on how AFC Brentford have risen through the leagues with liberal usage of football metrics.

        And a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/soccer/liverpool-premier-league-title.html">NYTimes</a>
        article on how Liverpool use data in transfer dealings.

        So what are you waiting for? Dive right in and enjoy the ride.
