I'm a Man United fan and one of the central point of contention on sites like [The Caf](https://redcafe.net) is if we need a DM or is the "McFred" (McTominay, Fred) double pivot good enough for a side with title winning aspirations. The other related question is if Pogba can play a part in the aforementioned double pivot at all or if he should instead be playing somewhere else (next to a DM, next to a playmaker, or both) to get the best out of him.

For my first post on data, I wanted to examine through data what a good midfield three looks like.
